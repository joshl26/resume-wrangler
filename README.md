## Introduction

Resume Wrangler is a dynamic and innovative resume and cover letter customization tool aimed at revolutionizing how jobseekers prepare their application materials. This web application provides an intuitive platform where users can input their professional information and automatically generate tailored resumes and cover letters based on specific job descriptions.

## Description

We take pride in our Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered software that scans resumes using an in-house ATS scanner. Additionally, we leverage open-source language grammar and spellchecking to further enhance our software's accuracy. We'll share more about this in future updates.

Users can easily input their professional information into the system, which then processes this data using advanced algorithms to generate tailored resumes and cover letters specifically designed for individual job postings. This not only simplifies the application process but also significantly enhances the relevance and appeal of the application documents to prospective employers.

The project's core functionality revolves around parsing user data and aligning it seamlessly with the qualifications sought by employers. It incorporates smart algorithms that highlight the most relevant experiences, skills, and achievements â€“ optimizing each application to stand out amidst competitive job markets.

Our platform offers two tiers of registered users:

- Basic user: This is a free membership tier that allows users to explore the platform and create customized cover letters and resumes. Currently, there are no download limits. However, in the future, basic users will be able to download a maximum of 5 PDFs per day.

- Pro user: For a small sign up fee of $TBD, users can upgrade to this tier and enjoy additional benefits. Users with Pro access can download up to 100 full-colour PDF vector graphics per day, complete with clickable links, customizable colours, and user images if desired. Users with Pro will also have access to a wider range of pre-made cover letter and resume templates to choose from.

## Key Features

- **Customization Engine:** Utilizes complex matching algorithms to ensure that pertinent details are emphasized in response to different job postings.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Offers a clean, responsive design for easy navigation through various functionalities.
- **Data Security:** Implement secure login mechanisms and encrypted personal data storage.
- **Direct Integration with Job Boards:** Fetches live data from popular hiring platforms for accurate tailoring of documents.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensures simple navigation and interaction across various functionalities within the platform.
- **Dynamic Customization Capabilities:** Uses bespoke algorithms to match users' profiles with suitable job descriptions, emphasizing necessary skills and experiences.
- **Data Security Measures:** Incorporates high-level security protocols to protect user data throughout their interaction with the service.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Frontend Development**: Utilized ReactJS for its superior handling of stateful interactions and responsive design capabilities, enhancing user experience. Tailwind CSS also played a large role in styling.
- **Backend Development**: Leveraged Next.js and its Node.js backend framework, providing a robust structure capable of efficiently managing multiple user requests simultaneously.
- **Database Management**: PostgreSQL was chosen for its reliability, robustness, and scalability. Facilitating smooth storage, retrieval, and manipulation of various types of personal user data.
- **Testing**: Next.js comes with Jest pre-configured out of the box, making it easy to start writing and running tests without any additional setup. Jest's ease of use, powerful features, and integration with Next.js make it a top choice for testing Next.js applications.
- **CI/CD**: The entire workflow from coding to deployment has been managed through Git. Highlights can be viewed on GitHub at [Resume Wrangler Repository](https://github.com/joshl26/resume-wrangler).

## Challenges Overcome

Developing a seamless interface between the frontend inputs and backend processing logic required meticulous debugging during the initial stages. Ensuring privacy while handling confidential user information prompted the implementation of advanced security protocols early in development.

One significant obstacle in this project involved integrating real-time job data fetching mechanisms from various sources while maintaining quick response times for end-users. Another challenge was ensuring that personalized content generation maintained accuracy in matching candidate skill sets with job demands while producing engaging narratives within cover letters.

I successfully addressed these challenges by utilizing sophisticated algorithmic approaches combined with current web technologies, making Resume Wrangler highly efficient yet straightforward enough for non-techie users.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates more than just programming proficiency; it showcases genuine foresight into future recruitment trends. It offers practical solutions that set me apart as a forward-thinking developer ready to tackle contemporary challenges in software development-related sectors with end-to-end solutions that address real-world problems.
