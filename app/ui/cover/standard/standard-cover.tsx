            Attached is a copy of my resume in response to the job posting for:
            JavaScript Full Stack Developer. This role appears to be an exciting
            opportunity where my skill set would prove to be a valuable addition
            to your company. My hands-on experience provides the following

              I have a strong appreciation for using Express, MongoDB, and
              Node.js for web development due to their seamless integration and
              robust capabilities. The combination of Expresses minimal and
              flexible framework, MongoDB NoSQL database for easy and efficient
              data storage, and Node.js efficient server-side programming
              language allows for efficient and scalable development.
              Additionally, these technologies are well-supported and constantly
              updated, offering a reliable and constantly evolving foundation
              for web applications.

              Typescript is an incredibly useful tool for web development. Its
              strong typing system helps me organize my code better and prevents
              errors, making my development process smoother and more efficient.
              Furthermore, Typescript supports modern JavaScript features and
              works well with popular web frameworks.

              As a developer, my experience with ReactJS has been both
              challenging and rewarding. I have found working with the library
              to be efficient and intuitive, but it does require a strong
              understanding of JavaScript fundamentals which I have strong
              background in.

            <p className="inline leading-2">
              I highly enjoy using NextJS for web development due to its
              streamlined and efficient framework. The built-in server-side
              rendering and automatic code splitting allow for faster loading
              times and better performance. Additionally, the ease of creating
              dynamic and interactive user interfaces using React components and
              the support for serverless functions make it a powerful tool for
              building modern, scalable web applications. NextJS intuitive
              file-based routing system and built-in CSS and Sass support also
              contribute to a more organized and cohesive development
              experience.
